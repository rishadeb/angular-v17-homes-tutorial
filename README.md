# Angular v17 Tutorial 

This repo contains code from the https://v17.angular.io/tutorial/first-app tutorial that I followed along to learn some angular.

Instead of using `fetch` as specified in the tutorial, this uses Angular's `HttpClient`

To run Mock API:
`json-server --watch db.json`

To run Angular App: 
1. `npm install`
2. `ng serve`
3. Go to: `http://127.0.0.1:4200/`
